# ElevateLabs_Task6
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of creating multiple passwords with varying complexity, testing them for strength, and identifying best practices for building strong and secure passwords.
It also explores common password attacks and explains how complexity impacts security.

ðŸ“Œ Steps Performed
1. Created multiple passwords with different complexity levels:

   Lowercase only

   Uppercase + lowercase

   Mixed characters (letters, numbers, symbols)

   Long random passwords

   Passphrases

2. Tested passwords using online strength checkers:

   Security.org Password Strength Tool

   Kaspersky Password Checker

   Password Meter

2. Recorded results including score, complexity, and tool feedback.

3. Identified best practices based on evaluation and research.

4. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary, credential stuffing, phishing).

5. Summarized findings on how complexity improves password security.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
Password complexity directly affects security. Longer and more complex passwords exponentially increase the number of possible combinations, making them more resistant to attacks. Combining complexity with good habits (like not reusing passwords) is essential for effective security.

ðŸ“Œ Outcome
Gained practical understanding of how to create strong passwords and defend against common password-based attacks.
